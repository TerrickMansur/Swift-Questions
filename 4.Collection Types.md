# Swift 5.2 

## Collection Types

### What are the three primary collection types in Swift?

`Arrays`, `Sets` and `Dictionaries`

### What are the two ways you can declare an Array?

    let arr = [Int]() // Short hand syntax
    let arr2 = Array<Int>() // Full written with type 

### How can  you create an array with a default value?

    var threeDouble = Array(repeating: 1.0, count: 3)

### How can you add two array together?

You can use the plus operator like so;

    let addedAtrr = arr1 + arr2

### What does it mean to create Array with an Array Literal? How does that look like?

    let arrayFromLiteral = [0, 1, 2, 3]

### How can you check the count of an array?

    array.count
    
### How can you check if an array is empty?

	array.isEmpty

#### How can you append an item to your array?

	array.append(item)
    
or 

	array += toAppendArray

### How do you retrieve a value from and array using subscript syntax?

	let value = array[2]
    
    
### How are Sets different then Arrays?

Sets do not have any ordering, its just a distinct values of the same type in a collection. 

### What protocol does the a object need to conform to in order to be able to be stored in a Set?

The `Hasable` protocol

### How can we create a set with an array literal?

	var someSet: Set<String> = ["One", "Two", "Three"]

### How can you modify s Set?

Through its methods and properties. 

### How can you find the amount of item in a Set?

	someSet.count

### How can you find out if a Set is empty?

	someSet.isEmpty

### How can you insert an item in a Set?

	someSet.insert("new item")

### How can you remove an item from a Set?

	someSet.remove("new item")

### How can you remove an items from a Set?

	someSet.remove("new item")

### How can you remove all items from a Set?

	sameSet.removeAll()
    
### How can you check if the Set contains an Item?

	someSet.contains("new item")

### How can you iterate through all the Sets items?

	for item in someSets { ... }

### How can you can all the Sets items sorted?

	someSet.sorted()

### What are some of Sets operations?

	a.intersection(b)
	
Will return a new set with all the items that appears in both Sets.
    
	a.symmetricDifference(b)

Will return a new Set with all the values except the once that appears in both of the Sets

	a.union(b)

Will return a new Set with all the values in both (no duplicate)

	a.subtracting(b)

Will return a new Set that removes all the items of the First Set that also appears in the Second Set. 

### What are some operator that you can use to compare Sets?

	==

To check is the Sets have all of the same items

	a.isSubset(of: b)

This will check if all items in `a` also appears in `b`

	a.isSuperset(of: b)

This will check if all the items in `b` also appears in Set `a`

	a.isStrictSubset(of: b) and a.isStrictSuperset(of: b)

Same is isSuperstes but also checks if they are not equal. 

	a.isDisjoint(with: b)

Will return true is the two sets have no items that are the same. 

### What are Dictionaries?

A Dictionaries stores associotions between keys of the same type and values of the same type. Each value is associated with a unique key. Dictionaries are not sorted. 

### How can you create an empty array?

	let dic = [String: Object]()
    
### How do you declare a Dictionary with a Dictionary literal?

	let dic: [String: Object] = ["key1" : Object(), "key2": Object()]

### How do you change an object associated with key?

	dic["key"] = newValue

You can also use:

	dic.updateValue(value, forKey: "key")

### How can you get the amount of objects in an Dictionary?

	dic.count

### How can you check if a Dictionary is empty?

	dic.isEmpty

### How can you remove a value from a Dictionary?

	dic.removeValue(forKey: "key")
    
This function will return the removes value. 

### How can you iterate through a Dictionary?

	for (key, value) in dic { ... }
