# Swift 5.2 

## Control Flow

### What are the three loops supported in Swift?

1. For loop
* While loop
* Repeat while loop


### With what protocol can you use the for loop?

The for loop can be used with the sequence protocol

### How does a for loop look like?

	for item in sequence { ... }
    
### How can you use a for look to loop through a Dicationary?

	for (key, item) in dictionary { ... }

### How can you use a for look to loop through a Range?

	for index in (0...5) { ... }

### How does a While Loop work?

A `While Loop` will contonie looping until a condition becomes false. 

### When do you use these loops?

These loops are bested used when you don't know the number of iteration before the loop begins.

### Write an example `While Loop`
	
	while true { 
		print("still looping")
	}

### What is the difference between a `While Loop` and a `Repeat while Loop`?

The `Repear While Loop` will execute the statement one time before checking the condition.

### Write an example `Repeat While Loop`?

	repeat {
    	...
    } while true

### What are conditional statements?

Conditional statement are statements that instructs the thread what pieces of code to execute and what to not execute based on conditions. 

### What are two coditional statments in Swift?

1. The `if` statement
* The `switch` statement

### Explain the if statement

With an `if` statement you can specify the code to execute a certain code only `if` some given statement is true.

### What is an `else if` statement?

An `else if` statement must be paired with an `if` statement. If the first `if` statement fails, the code will check the second `else if` statement. 

### What is a `else` statement?

An `else` statement must also be paired with an `if` statement, an it will execute its block of code only if the first `if` statement has not passed. 

### Explain a `switch` statement.

A `switch` compares a given value with several matching patterns and executes the code block associated with the macthing patterns.

### What is `switch` case?

With a `case` you declare the patterns you are looking to match

### What id the `default` case?

The `default` `case` is the patterns that will match/execute if none of the other cases match. 

### How does the Swift `switch` differ from the C/Obj-C switch?

The Swift switch does not automatically fall through the bottom of each case. Also each case much contain atleast one line of code. 

###  How can you force the switch cases to fall through?

By using the `fallthrough` key word in the code block that is executing for that case. 

### What are compound cases?

When you have more then one patterns for the same case. You can do this be adding additional cases behind the first one and seperate them with a coma. 

### What is intreval matching in a switch?

This is when you use ranges in order to match the value your using the `switch` by.

### How can you use tuple in a `switch`?

When running a `tuple` on a `switch` the `switch` will try to match each value in the tuple. However you can use un underscore when defining the pattern to indicate that value as a wildcard. 

### What is databinding in a `switch`? 

A `switch` `case` can define a temporary value that can be used in the `case` body. When defining the body, you can declare these variables in the `case` statement, this is called databinding.

### How is the `where` keyword used in a Switch?

In a `switch` you can use a where clause behind the pattern for an additional check on the datas that are binded. 

### What are Control Transfer Statements?

These are keywords that you can use to change the order of which your code is executed. 

### List the 5 Control Transfer Statements keywords in Swift, and explain what they do. 

1. continue
The continue tell a loop stop what it is doing and continue with the next iteration. It can only be used in loops. 
 
* break
The break statment would stop immediately and jump out of the execution. This can be used in loops and switches. 

* fallthrough
This can be used in a switch, by using the fallthrough keyword you will allows the execution to continue executing below the case that is matches. 

* return 
The return statement will return the result of the function you are in. 

* throw
The throw statement will exit out of the function with an error that will need to be caught.

### What is a Statement Label?

Statement Labels is a way to label your loops.

### What can you do with Statment Labels?

When you have nested Statement you can use theirs label to specify which statement you want to use the Transfer Statements on. 

### How does a guard statement work?

A guard statement is an conditional check that must be met before the conde continues running beyong it. If the guard is not met, you need to exit out early from the function. Variables or constant assigned during the guard will be available after the guard.

### What happens if the guard statement is not met?

You will need to define in an else statement after the guard how you would like to exit out of the function. This can be a return, continue, break or a fatalError.

## How can you check for API availability in Swift?

You can use an availability condition to conditionally execute code blocks in your code. 

	#available(iOS 10)

The compiler will use the availability information for this check.
