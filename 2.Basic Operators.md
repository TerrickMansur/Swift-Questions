# Swift 5.2 

## Basics Operators

##### What are operators?

Operators are symbols or phrases that you can use to change check or combine values. 

##### What does it mean for an operator to be unary, binary or ternary?

Unary operators take one targer (parameter)

Binary operators take two.

Trinary operators take three.

##### Write out how each of these operators are used?

Unary (prefix or post fix)
    
    !x
    x!
    
    
Binary

    a + b
    
Trinary (swift has only one)

    a ? b : c

##### What does the assignment operator do?

The assignment operator assings or updated a value to a `let` or `var`

##### How can you assing multiple variables on the same line?

    let (a, b): (Int, Float) = (0, 1.23)

##### Are there any differece with the assignment operator in Swift then in C/Objective-C?

Yes, the Swift assignment operator does not return a value. This is to prevent mistaken the use with `==`

##### List the arithmetic operators that Swift support?

1. Addition ( + )
* Subtraction ( - ) 
* Multiplication ( * )
* Division ( / )

##### Does these arithmetic operators support overflow?

By default they do not, but you can opt in for it by using the `&` sing infront of them. 

##### Explain the remainder operator.

The remainder operator ( a % b) works out how many times b fit in a, and returns the remainder. 

##### Explain the Unary Minus Operator

Use this operator if you would like to toggle the sign of a value. 

##### Explain the Unary Plus Operator.

This operator simple returns the same value it is on. It does not do anything. 


##### What are compound operators?

Compound operators are operator that are combined with an assignment and both taks are performed at the same time. 

    a += 5
    
##### What are comparison operators and how many are there?

The comparison operator are operators that compare two values and return a boolean. 

They include

Equal to;

    a == b

Not equal to;

    a != b

Greater than;

    a > b

Less than;

    a > b

Greater than or equal to;

    a >= b


Less than or equal to;

    a <= b

##### Can you compare tuples?

Only if the tuple consist of the same types. It will check from left to right. The left side taking precendent. 

##### Explain the Ternary Conditional Operator

This operator can be though of as an `if` `else` statement. If statement before the ? is true, return the value between the `?` and the `:` else return the value after the `:`.

##### Explain the Nil-Coalescing Operator (??)

This operator will return the value after the `??` of the value before it is `nil`.

##### List the Range Operators

1. Closed Range Operator
* Half Open Rage Operator
* One Sided Ranges

##### Explain the Closed Range Operator

This operator return a `ClosedRange` struct with the the value infront of the `...` as the lower bound and the value after the `...` as the upper bound. 

    let closedRange = (5...10)

##### Explain the Half-Open Range Operator

This operator return a `Range` struct with the the value infront of the `..<` as the lower bound but the value after the `..<` is not included, the item before it would be the upper bound. 

    let closedRange = (5..<10)


##### Explain the One-Side Ranges

With the One Side Range you can only specify the bound on one side of the range. The other side its bound is determined by the array it is used on.

    let items = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
    let setUpperBound = items[...3]
    let setLowerBound = items[3...]

##### What are logical operators?

Logical operator combine boolean values and gives you a new one. 

##### List the three Logical Operators

1. NOT ( !a )
* AND ( a && b )
* OR ( a || b )

##### Explain the NOT (!) Operator. 

The NOT operator will toggle the bool statement the follows it. 

##### Explain the AND Operator

The AND Operator return true if both of the boolean statement before and after it is true. 

##### Explain the OR Operator 

The OR Operator return true if either the boolean statement before or after the operator is true. 

##### Can you combine these Operators?

Yes you can. If there are two Binary Operator in the same statement;

    true || false && false

The compiler will evaluate the first operator from left to right. The two values and combine the result of that with the second operator. 

###### What id you would like to change this order?

Then you can use parentheses to change the order of precedence

    true || (false && true)
