# Swift 5.2 

## String and Characters

### What is the difference between a String and a Character type?

A Character type represents on letter, a String type represents a series of characters.

### How can you declare a string literal?

    let someString = "This is the string"

### How can you define a multiline leteral?

    let multiline = """
		This is 
		a multi line string declaration
        """
        
Use the double quote three time. Note, you cannot put any string value on the same line as the triple double quote. 

### How does the indenting of the multiline work?

On the first line, every white space will be ignored up to the first letter. The preceding lines will start where the first line its text starts. 

### List the escape characters in the string literal?

    \0 (null), \\ (backslash), \t (horizontal tab), \n (line feed), \r (carriage return), \" (double quote), ' (single quote), \u{123} (Unicode, the number is the Unicode number)
    
### How does extended delimeters work?

Use extended delimeters by serounding your string with the `#` character. This will make your string ignore the escapes and print the string as is. To use an escape sequence anyways, add a matching amount of `#` between your `\` and the character your escaping like so. `\#n\`

### How can I find out if a string is empty?

    let emptyString = ""
    emptyString.isEmpty
    
### Are string value or reference types?

String is value types. 


### Can you loop through a string?

Yes, String can be treated as a Sequence.

### How can you concatenate string ans character?

You can do this by using the `+` operator and the compound add operator `+=`. These will also worh with `Characters`. You can also use the `append` function.

### What is string interpolation?

String interpolation is the ability to construct a string with values of variables, literals and expression inside the string literal. 

    "Some is a \(variable) in the middle of the litteral"
    "Come \(2* 10) calculation in the middle of the litteral"

### Can you use unicode in string literals?

Yes, Swift string are fully Unicode-compliant. You can add them like so.

        "Come \u{1F425} on"

### How can we get the length of the string?

You can get this be using the count property. 

### How do you use the subscript of the String type?

The String type its subscript uses the `String.index` object to be able to subscript. You can used these to get a character in the string. 

### How can we easily look though s String?

    for index in value.indices { 
    	print(value[index])
    }

### How can we remove or insert one character from a string?

    var welcome = "hello"
    welcome.insert("!", at: welcome.endIndex)
    welcome.remove(at: welcome.index(welcome.endIndex, offsetBy: -1))


### How can you remove more then one character?

    let range =
    (welcome.startIndex
    ...
    welcome.index(welcome.startIndex, offsetBy: 1))

    welcome.removeSubrange(range)
    
### What is the different between a String and a Substring?

Substring you should use only when you are performing action on the string. When you have the final result, you should save it back into a String. The difference is performance and how memory is managed through their life cycle. The substring type will reference the memory address of the string itself. 


### List the three type you can compare String in Swift.

String and character equality 
   
    (first == second) (first != second)
    
Prefix equality

    first.hasPrefix("fi")

Suffix equality

    first.hasSuffix("fi")

### How can you look at the unicode representation of a character in a string leteral?

    for code in sr.utf8 {
        print(code)
    }
    
This can also be done with `.utf16` and `.unicodeScalars`
