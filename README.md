# Swift-Questions

These document are the Swift 5.2 book converted into question format. I find this a good way to quickly refresh your memory on the topics and quickly go over what you remember and what you may have forgotten.

Each chapter is represented by a file. These were written using the "The Swift Programming Language (Swift 5.2 beta)" book.
